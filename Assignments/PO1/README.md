We will use the README's that you will create in every assignment folder to do the following:

Top of the README:
Project Title
Your name
Project Description (It needs to be "descriptive". You can take text straight from the 
assignment / requirements with a little additions here and there.)

After description:
List all the files and or folders in that current project in a tabular format with a small 
description of each file.

The filename in that table should link to the actual code file or folder.

After table:
Instructions
Any and all information needed to run your code.
These instructions will be used for others in the class to run your project on their machine. 
I PROMISE: you will learn very fast how not to assume things just work. Because they DON'T. 
When your code doesn't run on anyone else's system and you get a zero, I bet you start to let 
"assumptions" go out the window.
